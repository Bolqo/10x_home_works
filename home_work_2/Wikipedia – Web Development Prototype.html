        <hr>
        <b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a <a href="">website</a> for the <a href="">Internet <strong>(World Wide Web)</strong></a> or an intranet <i>(a private network)</i>. <sup>[1]</sup>Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

        <p><mark>For larger organizations and businesses</mark>, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like <a href=""><em><ins><strong>Agile</strong></ins></em> methodologies</a> while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician.

        <h2>Evolution of web development technologies</h2>
        <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN.</p> 

        <p>The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, HTML was developed in 1993.</p>

        <p><mark>Web 1.0</mark> is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of information.Core protocols of web 1.0 were <em><b>HTTP, HTML and URI</b></em>.</p>
        
        <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
        <p>Web 2.0, a term popularised by Dale Dougherty, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.</p>

        <p><mark>Web 2.0</mark> introduced increased user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static, read-only nature of <b>Web 1.0</b> and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a user-focused, read-write online network.</p>

        <p>In the realm of <b>Web 2.</b>0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing activities such as creating music, files, images, and movies.<sub>[11]</sub> The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the <sup>"backbone of the internet,"</sup> using standardized XML (Extensible Markup Language) tags to authorize information flow from independent platforms and online databases.</p>


        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <p><mark>Web 3.0</mark>, considered the third and current version of the <em>web</em>, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a complete redesign of the web. Key features include the integration of metadata, precise information delivery, and improved user experiences based on preferences, history, and interests. <small><em>[citation needed]</em></small></p>
